## Install instuctions:
1. install Flutter by following the official website install instructions
2. Install the VS-Code [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) and [dart plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code)
3. Open the project
4. Open the VS-Code debug tab
5. Plug an *Android* OS supporting phone into you computer  
6. Press the Start Debugging button, you might need to select flutter from the drop down menu netxt to it
7. You phone should be selected as install medium and the app will boot there

## Alernative install app:
1. Navigate to the project folder
2. Open the terminal and type : _flutter run_
3. This should build the apk and deliver it to your phone so you can use the App (provided you plugged your phone in beforehand!)

## Info:
- There might be an error after registration, just press the reload button and fill in your account details
- Adding a phone number works only with a real number for verification, my current device (Samsung S6) doesn't need a manual code to be entered, so no solution for manul entering is currently given. If problem arise please contacte me, and I will try to sort them out asasp
- there could be some bugs on the way, I tried my best to remove them but it's still an early project,
- if you run this project via VS-Code, disable all debugging features or the application will stop sometimes, to fix that just press on the play button on the pop up menu
- it's also recommended to upload a menu file (the file in the video was just a place holder) and to fill in all opening dates (if you create a resturant) due to possible issues if they are not created
- I apologize for possible spellig mistakes
- If the search field doens't refresh even after restarting the app, consider a phone reboot

If any issues arrive please let me know.
